# Weather Application

This app provides current local weather information such as location, forcast, humidity, wind speed and uv index. It can also switch between Fahrenheit and Celcius. It uses the native browser's geolocation to get latitude and logitude and the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather data for that location.

## How to use

You will need to have an app id to use the api. The id goes here:
`var _appId = /* App Id goes here */;`

You can view a live demo of it [here](https://codepen.io/DevchamploO/full/OMyvpx/).
